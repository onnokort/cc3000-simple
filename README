Simplified CC3000 library
-------------------------
This is a try at getting the CC3000 working with a simple uC setup as
possible and containg the TI code in a clean way.
Also, the set of functions/hooks that needs to be replaced with
custom code is clear and has been reduced to a minimum. Hardware-wise, 
the following, minimal configuration is used:

- one regular interrupt (e.g. ARM systick timer)
- completely software SPI, taken and adapted from the ArduinoCC300
  library at https://github.com/cmagagna/ArduinoCC3000.git

No hardware SPI or external interrupt is needed. Of course, this means that
using this library to talk to a CC3000 chip might make it slower than
needed and will use more of the uCs resources.


This is (so far) an adaptation of version V1.11 of the TI library,
'swrc277.zip', with MD5 a6c5b8bf2c62321a6d7bae35faf76ced.


If you use this modified library, I appreciate questions & feedback to
